Salt stack large macros vs small macros and the pillar

1. Copy paste
2. One macro to rule them all
3. Flexibility: dry with style

if there will be one 'something', use pillar + regular state include.
if several (nginx sites, for example), use macro + pillar options branch as argument

nest instead of underscoring
