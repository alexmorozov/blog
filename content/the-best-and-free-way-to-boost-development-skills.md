How to perfect your team's skills by contributing to opensource: 7 tips
7 tips to perfect your team's skills by contributing to opensource

------


Recently i got an email from some software company CEO. He was looking for a
mentor: a skilled expert who could help boosting developers' skills. You know,
code review, design tips, all that stuff.

But how much he was suprised when I told him that he'd rather consider
encouraging his devs to contribute to opensource projects. He apparently treated
it as a completely unrelated thing. That, in turn, suprised me quite a bit, so
today I'd like to elaborate a bit more on this topic.

Well, how much does *that* actually help to perfect coding and design skills?
From my standpoint, it's invaluable to virtually every proficiency level. See
for yourself:

### Interns and newcomers

Two problems we all face when dealing with newbies: a) not to break things
that already work, and b) determine if he talented enough to suit us as a regular
worker.

And what do we do usually? "Go read our codebase", "go fix some docs". Do you
really think writing docs is much more easier than coding? I'm sorry, but
you're wrong. And sometimes it even results in giving the intern the paperwork
or making him or her just reading the books "just so he learns before doing
something". Oh gosh, no.

Anyways. I bet you're using some opensource libraries and tools for your
project. Likely a handful of them. And there are certainly some stupid,
easy-fixable bugs in them that bother you all the time. So just ask your intern
to fix one. And this task will test the whole spectrum of the successful
developer's habits:

* Refine an actual problem
* Find an acceptable solution
* Code the fix
* Communicate with the tool or library core devs to get things merged

*HINT*: In case you're a newbie yourself, you might have already guessed: the best
experience you can show off to your employer are your contributions to some
public repos.

### Junior and Middle devs

Every (well, almost) junior coder wants to become a senior one. But what's the major difference between them?

vary work so it doesn't bore
always pushing beyond the limits
not to stop, not to freeze

work on opensourcing your own libs

### Seniors

dry

triaging issues
design
Deprecation

applicable not only to libraries, where the developers are main users, but to
REST APIs as well (which seem to become a must-have for almost every web
project).

Some of projects have much larger userbase, than your project.

### Team leads and CTOs
where to find good devs?
    who to hire?
hiring heaven: candidates you're 100% confident in, just because they
already wrote some code for *your project*, not some sample one.


### The myths

There is a bunch of myths around the opensource. I'll concern a few:

#### it's for students only
#### there are only bugs, they won't accept my new feature -
#### nobody needs our in-house lib: promote your opensource projects (and work itself)
so hard to start: choose the right project


--------------

github made it extremely easy ACTION: Go fork
so make yourself a christmas gift you'll never regret. Start. Contributing. To. Opensource.
