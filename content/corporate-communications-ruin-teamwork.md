![Communications ruin your teamwork]({filename}/images/communication-models/flawed-communications.jpg)

A couple of months ago, I faced a sensitive issue. A freshly hired C-suite
executive - a talented and hard-working person - was consistently undermining
our team spirit. You must have met this kind of personality in life. They never
cross the fine line, but the very essence of their existence seems to be
finding faults in others and keeping everyone around up to speed on those
discoveries. What's the worst, they do it in private conversations only, which
leaves you with an awkward choice. Either you report the behavior and become a
'whiner who discloses private talks' or let them get away with it, unwittingly
encouraging the misconduct.

In less than a month, her whole department picked up on that toxic behavior.
It was hard to resist the uber-populist idea that they were the only
hard-workers in the company, whilst the others got paid for doing nothing.

What did the CEO do to manage conflict between staff? Well, not much. He was
afraid of losing any of employees, including the new executive. So he called a
couple of meetings to warn everyone that a conflict between departments is
intolerable. As you might have guessed, that didn't have a lasting effect.

The problem was exacerbated by the structure of our company. The team is
distributed across the country with just over 10% working at the offices.
Because of that, it was quite hard to employ traditional teambuilding
techniques.

## Fallout

At first, it was difficult to estimate the cost of conflict directly. After
all, it's not a disaster, right? So thought the CEO. Until our two best
salesmen departed just before the high season, citing tensions in the workplace
as a primary reason.

Then appeared the wider, even more dismal consequences of conflict.
Productivity in all departments plummeted. Not only because of constant
quarrels but because they hadn't been addressed directly and openly by the
management. Many regarded that as a carte blanche to do whatever they wanted at
work.


## The Root Cause

Being a part of the executive team, I couldn't just stand by and watch the
teamwork downfall.  After having a couple of talks with the new executive, I
realized that she's quite happy with her behavior and doesn't want to change a
thing. In a private conversation with the CEO, he directly asked me whether I
was in favor of letting the person go. But despite a burning desire to cut the
tangle with one stroke, I asked for a timeout. Why? Because I hit upon an idea.

As I dug deeper, it became apparent that the new executive's personality was
not the root of evil. Of course, her manners were horrible, but there was
something else that allowed those manners to inflict the company such damage.

It was our communication technology. The tools we used didn't protect us from
non-compliant behavior. More than that, to some extent they encouraged it. You
might be wondering, what kind of technology we used? Well, our setup was pretty
standard. We used what I call the Functional model.

## The Functional Model

It emerges naturally from the functional structure of a company. We were no
exception.

![Functional communication model]({filename}/images/communication-models/functional-communication-model.png)

If you have a request for another department, you first reach out to the head
of that division. Next, you're connected to a specific employee in a unit and
communicate with her directly. In case of any questions, you reach out to the
head again.

### Example

On the diagram, we see initial communication requests: gray dotted lines. Bob
from IT has an issue to figure out with Marketing, Judy's laptop stopped
working, and Rob would like to update the CRM so that Sales would be affected.
Everyone first calls up the corresponding head of the department, and then they
continue to communicate with department staff (blue lines). As it often
happens, Rob and Judy know each other pretty well, so when Rob has a question
for Marketing, he just pings Judy directly, bypassing usual subordination. This
channel is a red line on the diagram.

Communications under this model are usually held via private messages, emails
and telephone calls.

### Pros

* It's easy to set up. In fact, there's nothing to set up.
* There's no need to train staff.

### Cons

* It's a mess. Fellow PMPs will quickly notice that for 20 people we'll end up
  having up to 380 communication channels, which is unmanageable.
* It's least resilient to employees with a negative attitude. They can spread
  toxic behavior via private messages which are hard to inspect. In fact, this
  deficiency of the model made possible all the destructive behavior of our new
  executive.
* It's biased and suppresses teamwork. Heads of divisions set the tone of all
  discussions, and often make decisions based on politics, not value.
* It's non-transparent. Nobody knows the full story, even the seniors.

Once I understood the real culprit of our issues, I started exploring other
communication models. The first one that came to mind was a project-centric
structure.

## The Projectized model

When a company understands that the Functional model hinders its performance,
it usually switches to the Projectized model. For each ongoing project, a
virtual group is created, and all communication is held in there.

![Projectized communication model]({filename}/images/communication-models/projectized-communication-model.png)

Most of the time, group emails are used for that purpose. Every time you have a
new project, you just create a new list of recipients, and you're all set.

### Example

On the diagram, we see the three departments working on three different
projects. As they have group-based communication (colored lines), information
is easily accessible for each project team member. Notice, though, that
conversations regarding daily operations (gray dashed lines) are still
peer-to-peer, using the Functional model.

### Pros:

* A huge reduction of communication channels compared to the Functional model.
* Focused groups with a good degree of transparency.
* Easy to set up.

### Cons:

* The majority of companies have matrix structure: several cross-department
  projects and operations within functional departments. The Projectized
  communication model addresses only needs of the former, leaving non-project
  communication under the Functional model.
* It's still too rigid to fit with contemporary agile workflow
* This model disconnects projects (read - growth) and operations (sustaining
  and stability), effectively siloing them based on the communication model.


The drawbacks of the Projectized model were too significant for us, so I turned
to the agile community for inspiration.


## The Bazaar model

The aforementioned department isolation of the Projectized model is a big
obstacle to a popular DevOps framework widely employed by startup companies. To
overcome it, organizations sometimes make a 180-degree turn and make all the
communications public and centralized.

![Bazaar communication model]({filename}/images/communication-models/bazaar-communication-model.png)

One of the most popular tools using this approach is Slack. You create a set of
public channels to broadcast everything to subscribed members. As a rule,
channels represent inter-department groups working on both projects and
operations.

### Example

The diagram shows us that instead of using peer-to-peer conversations, all
involved parties now communicate in dedicated channels (colored lines). Those
channels encompass project work and all the related ongoing operations. Also,
there's a company-wide public channel (red dotted lines) for discussing general
things.

### Pros:
- Improves transparency and encourages collaboration
- Helps quickly get new employees up to speed

### Cons:
* This model is good for small companies with 10 or fewer employees. As the
  organization grows, the central communication spot quickly becomes a mess
  because of tons of groups/channels for every purpose.
* There is no separation of cross-department and intra-department work. As a
  result, it can become hard to find the right information in the haystack of
  noise.
* Responsibility gets diluted in this scenario, as we don't have per-department
  communication groups anymore.


Probably, this agile model would fit some other company, but we clearly weren't
ready for such a dramatic switch. We needed something in between: a model that
would foster collaboration, promote transparency, and encourage project work
while not downplaying regular operations. To achieve all these results, I
designed the Service-oriented model.

## The Service-oriented model

It's based on the [Service-Oriented Architecture][1] concept from IT field.This
approach doesn't just follow existing information flows, but instead re-models
it, putting the flows in the right direction.

![Service-oriented communication model]({filename}/images/communication-models/service-oriented-communication-model.png)

Every department has two communication channels: external and internal. An
internal channel is used for intramural discussions that affect department's
staff only. And all the requests and suggestions from the other divisions go to
the external channel.

### Example

In this example, we have three external channels: 'Our tech', 'Our product',
'Our sales'. If Ruth has anything related to the technology component, be that
a faulty computer or a suggestion to improve website navigation, she sends it
to 'Our tech'. Similarly, when Bob wants to give a heads up about a CRM
upgrade, he notifies everyone in Sales by posting his message in 'Our sales'.
Most of the projects are held in one of these public channels. If any of
projects grows too large, like an 'Epic Project', then (and only then) it gets
a separate channel.

### Pros:

* The model provides maximum transparency for operations
    * Everyone in a department sees ongoing operations and is up to speed with everything going on.
    * Everyone outside the department sees the real amount of work being done by that department.
* It encourages initiative
    * Managers can join the discussion anytime, but generally division members solve incoming issues themselves
* It promotes team responsibility
    * Being represented as a 'service' to others helps team members go from individual to collective responsibility.
* **No conflict**. As everything, from projects to operations to smalltalk, is public, no one ever dares to speak ill of anyone else.

### Cons:

* Of all the models, this has the greatest friction of deployment. Mainly, it's
  about people's reluctance going public with everything, not only project
  work.
* Employees need training to choose the right channel for their messages.
* There is clearly more information to consume. Open communication might lead
  to overwhelming communication.

## Outcomes

So how did our story unfold? After a brief discussion, the CEO greenlighted a
move to the new model. It took us about a week to set up a Zulip environment
and design channels. And then only one roadblock was left on our way to
success: inertia.

People naturally resist change, let alone a change in a way they communicate at
work. Surprisingly, among the most outspoken opponents were the people who had
been hit the hardest by interdepartmental conflict. Even after the switch, we
had to track attempts of keeping online conversations private and nip them in
the bud.

And our efforts have paid off. In just a week after the migration, we took a
straw poll with employees. No single conflict was reported. Being forced to
communicate in public space, everyone became polite and team-oriented.

Productivity has soared. Not only because there was no conflict, but because
everyone's efforts were now public. That worked better than any preaches on
valuing work of others and doing the best oneself.

Also, the team felt much tighter. It's hard to come up with a quantifiable
measure of team spirit, but the average number of participants in company-wide
discussions almost doubled.

## Switching to the Service-oriented model in your company

Since then, I recommended several friends of mine switching to this model at
work. They asked a lot of questions which made me understand the model might
look complex at first. Here are some frequent questions with answers.

### How does the model change bad attitude?

It might sound irrational first, but not only thoughts define behavior, but
behavior also influences thoughts in a big way. When you keep saying that the
world is a beautiful place, you're more likely to notice evidence of that.
That, in turn, reinforces or even modifies your system of beliefs. So once bad
guys start behaving, they soon find themselves thinking well of others.

### How can I make sure the transition goes smoothly?

In short, you can't. There's an opinion that you can plan out everything. That
might work for simple projects, but not the one that deals with intangible
things like the way people are used to communicate. So instead of visualizing
the migration as a 'A -> B' path, instead prepare to a realistic 'A -> Chaos ->
B' route. Don't try to make it perfect the first time, but allow for several
iterations.

### What tool to use?

In most cases, you'll want to use a tool like Slack. We use [Zulip][2] - an
alternative to Slack having an extremely useful feature: every message has a
topic, just like email. This allows us to clearly separate different
discussions within a single channel.

### Why not have a single channel for each division?

First, each department has a lot of daily technical talk that would be a noise
if posted on the public channel. That doesn't mean that the internal channel is
somehow private and inaccessible for others, it's just an information flow
separator. Channel names usually copy departments' names, like 'IT',
'Accounting', or 'Sales'.

Second, every division has a product or service it creates for other divisions
and customers. The task of an external channel is to focus on that service,
creating healthy communication line between different departments. These
channels should be named after the service, for example: 'Our Tech', 'Doc
flow', or 'Promotion'.

### Who answers in an external channel?

Depending on particular department, you can either make everyone responsible
for processing inbound requests or choose several people to answer. The former
case, albeit a bit anarchic, is more valuable in terms of teams' awareness
of what's going on.

### Which channels do staff see?

Every employee receives notifications from at least two channels of his or her
department - the internal one and outside-facing one. Besides that, he or she
can send a message to any outside-facing channels of other departments.

### How do projects fit into this model?

To ensure maximum agility and transparency, we decided not to create separate
channels for each and every ongoing project. Instead of that, we employ the
feature of our tool of choice I mentioned earlier - the ability to set topics
to messages, to keep track of projects right in the external channels. This
reflects the specific nature of our projects. They are usually short-lived
(less than three months each), so we just create a separate topic for a project
within a channel. If your company's work cycle assumes long-running projects,
you might want to dedicate separate channels to them.

### What additional channels to create?

Cross-departmental operations channels. Depending on the company's structure,
there might be active ongoing operations across several departments. For
instance, adding a new vendor might require Legal, Sales, and Marketing
efforts. For that purpose, it makes sense to launch a 'New vendors'
communication channel.

Small talk channels. Our team of ~50 members has around 20 channels. Among the
most popular ones are 'General', 'Ahaha', and 'Congrats', with self-descriptive
names.
