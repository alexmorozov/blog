Hi, my name is Alex Morozov, and I'm from Russia.

My passion is developing cool e-commerce websites and making the existing ones
more profitable. You can find more information on my
[LinkedIn page](https://dk.linkedin.com/in/djangoengineer).

I have studied at Moscow State Academy of Informatics and Instrument Engineering.
Bachelor of Science, Informatics in Economics, 2004.

I devote most of my spare time to my wife and daughter, though not giving
up trying to master boxing.
