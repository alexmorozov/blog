So you've put together a scrum-based workflow in your company. From now on
you'll deliver projects on time, and the boss will praise you every time he
sees you. Look, he's just turned up. What is he going to say? Words of
gratitude? Oh wait. What does he mean by 'put things on hold for a bit and
switch to a super-urgent project'? But we've just set up a board... AND STICKERS!


Ideal companies. Management always interferes. But that's good, it minimizes the chances of you delivering the dead-born crap.
Sticking to a plan isn't worth a damn if the objective itself is obsolete.
Pivoting - startups' buzzword. Change directions swiftly and recover fast if you're screwed.

Problems
usually you end up turning off 80% of features in an issue tracker.
How to address them


why trello

board/list/card can change meaning from board to board.

If you're working

What's wrong with common trackers?

so you try to fit pegs of all shapes into square holes.
bc you think the project is done when all the project's tasks are done
it doesn't work that way
constantly changing things


JIRA, Trac, you name it.

### "Heroic plans" board

time-based planning
heroic plans
	calendar - by quarter

### Project's board

scrum
    backlog
    points
    iterations

### Developer's board

Story is a list

developer
	kanban
	current story
	churn


when it's ready from the developer's point of view, it might not be from the cto's point. and VICE VERSA!
